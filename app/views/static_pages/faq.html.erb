<h4 id="internalLink1">How did you select the content in the Digital Collections Website?</h4>
<br>
The Digital Collections Website is a gateway to the digital collections created and acquired by the UCSD Libraries and designed to support the needs of our undergraduate and graduate students and the public. More than 16,000 digitized items - including photographs, documents and moving images - can be found here. They reflect a range of materials collected, managed and preserved by the UCSD Libraries to support teaching, learning and research. Content has been drawn from the collections of the Arts Library, Mandeville Special Collections Library and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Library with strengths in the topical areas of Baja California, Melanesia, oceanography, Spanish Civil War, and UCSD campus history.

<br>
Not all of the contents in all of the UCSD Libraries collections have been digitized. The Libraries decide what items to digitize and make available online based on a number of considerations (including the need to support teaching and research, available funding and resources for digitization, copyright restrictions that may prevent the item from being distributed online, and the scholarly significance of the item).

<h4 id="internalLink13">What is the technical architecture of the Digital Collections Website?</h4>
<br>
The Digital Collections Website is an expression of the UCSD Libraries XDRE (eXtensible Digital Resource Environment) framework which is built on the following components: RDF (Resource Descriptive Framework), Solr (search server based on Lucene), JSON (Java Script Object Notation data exchange format), SRB (storage resource broker), ARK (Archival Resource Key) and a Java based development platform. For the Digital Collections Website XDRE produces XML as a web service and uses XSLT, CSS and AJAX to produce the HTML output displayed in the browser.
<br> <br> <hr> <br>

<h4 id="internalLink14">What is the Digital Object URL and metadata link displayed in the descriptive metadata?</h4>
<br>
The Digital Object URL and metadata view provides the user with a citable persistent universal resource locator (URL); the technical information about how the digitized item was scanned; and additional descriptive metadata associated with the item that is indexed and searched including alternative titles, abstracts and translations where appropriate.

<h4 id="searchTips">Searching Tips</h4>
<br>
<b>The Search (keyword) option is available from the home page and every results page.</b>

<br><br><p>About Search:
<ul>
<li>For an exact phrase search, enter words and/or phrases surrounded by quotes (").
  <ul>
    <li>The default search will look for these words and phrases in titles, names, dates, topics and identifiers.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>To exclude a word or phrase, put a minus sign (-) before it.</li>
<li>Keyword search does not support Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT). However, entering a multiple keyword search will work like Boolean AND. Results will be returned only when ALL of the keywords appear.</li>
<li>Searching is not case sensitive. For example, searching for 'dancers solomon islands' or 'DANCERS SOLOMON ISLANDS' will yield the same results.</li>
<li>Very common words (a, and, the, do, of, etc.) are ignored.</li>
<li>Results are sorted by relevance and the scoring of a result depends on a number of factors:
  <ul>
    <li>The more times a search term appears the higher the score. Also matches on rarer terms count more than matches on common terms.</li>
    <li>If there are multiple terms in a query, the more terms that match, the higher the score.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<b>The Advanced Search option is available from the home page and every results page.</b>

<br><br><p>About Advanced Search:
<ul>
<li>User can determine which Boolean operator to apply in search:
  <ul>
    <li>Find all words (AND)</li>
    <li>Find any word (OR)</li>
    <li>Without these words (NOT)</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Supports limiting search to specific fields: title, name/creator or topic or expanding search to keyword (title, name/creator, topic and notes).</li>
<li>Supports searching full text (when available).</li>
<li>Supports searching all collections or narrowing to a specific collection or multiple collections using check-boxes.</li>
</ul>
<br> <br> <hr> <br>

<h4 id="internalLink15">Can I narrow my search results more than once?</h4>
<br>
Yes. As you can see below, on your search results page, the plus symbol in the Narrow Your Results box allows you to see all possible terms by which you can narrow a search. For example, if you click on the plus symbol next to Topic you will see topics assigned to the items in your search results. To narrow the result set, choose the topics of interest by clicking the box next to each topic and then complete your selection by clicking on the blue Find button at the bottom of the box. Note that you can see all of the topics associated with your result set by clicking on the highlighted Choose more....
You may at any time select additional terms or deselect terms for your results, but always complete your selection by clicking on the blue Find button at the bottom of the box.
